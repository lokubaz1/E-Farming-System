# E-Farming-System
E-farming is a new business model that allows farmers to sell their products anytime
without the involvement of a middleman. Here, I built a user-friendly website that provides
a platform for buying and selling farm products online. This online e-farming project will
help farmers sell their products online. The main objective of this project is to deliver
farming products especially organic food to buyers and help farmers use a computerized
approach for better profits.
